# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # mdpi	1.0x
  # hdpi	1.5x
  # xhdpi	2.0x
  # xxhdpi	3.0x
  # xxxhdpi	4.0x
  assets:
    - images/
    - images/1.5x/
    - images/2.0x/
    - images/3.0x/
    - images/4.0x/
    - images/interest-icons/
    - images/profile-icons/
    - images/setting-icons/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansKR
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/KaiGenGothicKR-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/KaiGenGothicKR-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/KaiGenGothicKR-Light.ttf
          weight: 100



  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
